* [[https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html#creating-a-new-rails-project-installing-rails|Installations]], basically this contains:
	1. Ruby - back-end language
	2. A database management app - here sqlite3 is used
	3. Node.js, npm and yarn - for managing JS written on the site.
	4. Rails - which is a gem. It can be installed globally. Running `rails new app_name` in the terminal creates the basic scaffolding.
* Checking if the Rails app is running. Simply run `rails server` on the terminal, which provides a URL.
* Open the URL in the browser, and a simple page with Rails logo can be seen. You're done.
