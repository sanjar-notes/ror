# 2. Toy App - Models, Views
Created Monday 20 December 2021

#### 1. Planning the app
- Create an app called `toy-app-rails` using the same steps as in the [previous ](obsidian://open?vault=ruby-on-rails&file=Home%2F2._Resources%2Frailstutorial_book_read%2F1._From_Zero_to_deploy) chapter.
- This app is a Twitter clone, well kind of. It has two datum:
	- **Users** (id: integers, email: string, name: string)
	- **MicroPosts** (id: integer, content: text, user_id: integer). We're using `text` instead of `string` (255 chars) for flexibility in content size, if a change is needed later.
	- Each post is associated with a author(user). i.e. `user_id` of micropost is the author's `id`.
- Generate `Users` Model using [scaffold](obsidian://open?vault=rubyon-rails&file=3.%20Scaffolding) generator

#### 2. The Users Resource
* Bundler: it's a gem file installer. Config is at /Gemfile.
* `rails s` starts the local server.
* MVC basics. 
	* Browser request goes to router, router decides controller (and controller action) based on **URI**.
	* Controller action calls Model functions and stores data as it's instance variables.
	* Model has code to interact with the database. This code is provided by Rails, and doesn't need to be touched, generally.
	* View can access all controller instance variables. Uses ERB templates to template stuff.

#### 3. MVC in action
* A detailed walkthrough of what happens in a HTTP request-response cycle.
* In this case with the `Users` resource.

*  Also, an important note from the author: Some references indicate that the view returns the HTML directly to the browser (via a webserver such as Apache or Nginx). Regardless of the implementation details, I find it helpful to think of the controller as a central hub through which all the applicationâ€™s information flows.

* REST architecture and default (named) actions for a controller (`UserController` here).

#### 4. Weaknesses of this `Users` Resource
* No data validations - I could create users without specifying email or name or both. Not good.
* No authentication - there's no security. Anyone can access any user, and modify it. CIA triad (Confidentiality is non-existent).
* No styles - looks bland.
* No tests - well, the scaffold has *some* tests, but doesn't have place for custom tests, or authentication.
* **No real understanding/learning** - scaffolding is awesome, but it's very bad for learning something.
