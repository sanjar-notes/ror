# 5. Filling in the layout
###### Asset pipeline
- A **single** folder for all static files ("assets"), like images, CSS and other stuff.
The location is `app/assets/`. 
- It has typewise subfolders - Images are stored in `/images` and stylesheets in `/stylesheets`, etc.

###### Server's assets directory
- The asset directory in development is not the same as the asset directory used by the server. They are different.
- The server has all (types of) assets in a single folder, for easy access.
- All assets have a unique long alphanumeric string appended to their names, to avoid reusing browser-cached assets, generally.

###### ERb tag helper functions
- These are Ruby functions that return HTML output as string.
- Why: To add Ruby logic to plain HTML tags, which eases writing View (V in MVCa) code.
- Because they evaulate to strings, helper functions can be nested.

###### Links in ERb using `link_to`
- The function `link_to` is used for inserting links. 
- Why:
	- DRY for long URLs
	- Avoid hardcoding of links (impact of change reduction).
- Function template is `link_to(content, url [, options=Hash])`. Content may be string or other ERb helper functions.
- **Note, in Ruby, trailing hash argument need not have enclosing `{}` - continuing it as comma separated values is OK.  Example: `f(23, alt: 'pic', width: "23")`.
- The hash contains tag attributes in Hash form. e.g. CSS `:class`, `:id` and other attributes.

	Examples:
	```HTML
	<%= link_to "Home", '#' %>
	==> renders to <a href="#">Home</a>


	<%= link_to "Sign up now!", '#', class: "btn btn-lg btn-primary" %>
	==> <a href="#" class="btn btn-lg btn-primary">Sign up now!</a>


	<%= link_to image_tag("rails.svg", alt: "Rails logo", width: "200"), "https://rubyonrails.org/" %>
	==> <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/"> <img alt="Rails logo" width="200px" src="/assets/rails-<long-string>.svg">
		</a>
	```

###### Images in ERb using `image_tag`
- Embedded image tag helper.
- Function template: `image_tag(src_path [, options=Hash])`. The options hash has usual image attributes like `alt`, `width` etc, all having string values.
- As image is an asset, a unique string is appended by the server for client HTML.
- Example: 
	```HTML
	image_tag("rails.svg", alt: "Rails logo", width: "200")
	==> <img alt="Rails logo" width="200px" src="/assets/rails-<long string>.svg">
	```
