A model is a class associated with a table (table record actually).
It stores info of two things:
- Data in the record
- Relations with other models (one to one, one to many etc).

The model class inherits from the `ActiveRecord::Base` class, which contains functions to interact with the database, and populate the instance variable from the record(s) receieved after querying. Writing SQL is not required.
